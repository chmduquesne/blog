                <article>
                    <p>I <a href="http://blog.chmd.fr/sigal-a-static-gallery-generator.html">recently</a>
set up a self-hosted gallery for my pictures. Obviously, I did this
because I wanted to stop giving my content to external platforms, but also
to gain some level of privacy: I want to limit the number of people who
are able to look at these pictures.</p>
<p>While setting up the gallery was relatively easy, restricting the access
was an interesting problem. I did not want to use a global
<code>username:password</code> combination, because this kind of credentials
inevitably become public at some point. A different combination for each
user would have been better, but some people are not as careful as I am
with their own credentials, and they may just give away their own access
to others. It is also a lot of maintenance, and I don't want to deal with
the risks involved with securely processing my friends' passwords.</p>
<p>I then had a look at single sign on solutions such as openid. This kind of
technology was appealing, for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>No password to process on my side</li>
<li>People would identify with a very personal account (gmail, facebook),
  that they are unlikely to be willing to share with anyone else.</li>
<li>It is very easy to use for the end user.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have thus been looking for a solution to get openid/oauth authentication
to cooperate with lighttpd in order to protect my new gallery. After some
work, I came up with <a href="https://git.chmd.fr/?p=lighttpd-external-auth;a=blob_plain;f=external-auth.lua">a lua magnet
script</a>
that does the job. It is inspired by <a href="https://github.com/tai/mod-auth-ticket-for-lighttpd">this
module</a>, but it does
not require to be compiled and works out of the box on recent versions of
lighttpd (e.g.  debian stable). I also believe that it offers <a href="https://github.com/tai/mod-auth-ticket-for-lighttpd/issues/4">a better
security</a>.</p>
<p>It works pretty well! You can try to visit
<a href="https://gallery.chmd.fr">gallery.chmd.fr</a>  and you should be presented
with my very own login page. Should you try to login, the script will
gently tell you that though your openid/oauth login was successful, you
cannot access the gallery because it is a privilege reserved to the people
I explicitly authorized. Beware that if you are not using linux, you might
experiment a warning from your browser: that is because I use a
certificate signed by <a href="http://www.cacert.org/">cacert</a>, a community-driven
certificate authority whose root certificate is not included in commercial
OS (yet).</p>
<p>If you want to use this script on your own lighttpd server, I have set up
a <a href="http://lighttpd-external-auth.chmd.fr/">dedicated website</a> to explain
how to proceed. Check it out!</p>
<p>One last thing: I am not a security expert, and I did this for fun. I
believe it is pretty secure (provided you trust the third parties
involved, of course), but I still have to warn you: don't use this to
protect important documents. If you have knowledge about security and want
to comment - or even better: to contribute - be my guest!</p>
