articles about doing SSH over SSL. I have been improving my configuration
over the years, so the more recent, the better:</p>

<p>Another episode of my adventures of firewall bypassing...</p>
<p>In order to use the http CONNECT method to tunnel ssh, you have to
configure apache as I previously showed in <a href="../ssh-over-ssl-a-quick-and-minimal-config.html">a previous post</a>.  Sadly,
the current version of apache does not allow to do it over https. There
has been a <a href="https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=29744">bug report</a> for years and various patches have been
proposed, but as far as I know, still not any of these patches made it to
the official release.</p>
<p>My solution so far was to apply the patch manually and recompile the
relevant module. Doing this for every release can be annoying, so I've
been looking for a different solution that would not involve recompiling
apache.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 2015-05-07:</strong> This bug has been fixed for 3 years. I still
recommend not to use the CONNECT method, because only apache supports it
and it will force you to use it. There are cooler, faster webservers out
there. Using the HAproxy based configuration is by far the most flexible
way I know (it allows you to use any web server, apache included).</p>
<p>The workaround I now use is fun enough for me to talk about it here. Since
apache has no problem with the CONNECT method when SSL is not involved, I
have decided to do the SSL part by myself. Thus, I configure apache to
serve normally on the port 80, and I use stunnel to secure apache on the
port 443. Here is how I do it: I remove the SSL part of my apache config
and I add in my (normal, unencrypted) apache configuration:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>ProxyRequests On
AllowConnect 22
<span class="nt">&lt; Proxy</span> <span class="err">*</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    Order deny,allow
    Deny from all
<span class="nt">&lt;/Proxy&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;Proxy</span> <span class="err">127.0.0.1</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    Order deny,allow
    Allow from all
<span class="nt">&lt;/Proxy&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Then, I install stunnel, and I set it up to listen on the port 443
(https) and to forward it to the port 80 (http).</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">cert</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">etc</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">stunnel</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">stunnel</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">pem</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="p">...</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="o">[</span><span class="n">https</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="n">accept</span><span class="w">  </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">443</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="k">connect</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">80</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="n">TIMEOUTclose</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<p>stunnel requires a bit of configuration. From the <a href="http://www.stunnel.org/?page=docs">documentation</a>, here
is how to generate a certificate:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="err">cd /etc/stunnel</span>
<span class="err">openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -nodes -config stunnel.cnf -out stunnel.pem -keyout stunnel.pem</span>
<span class="err">chown stunnel:stunnel stunnel.pem</span>
<span class="err">chmod 600 stunnel.pem</span>
</pre></div>


<p>I also nedded to add in /etc/hosts.allow</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">sshd</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">ALL</span>
<span class="n">stunnel</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">ALL</span>
<span class="n">https</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">ALL</span>
</pre></div>


<p>And that is all. I restart stunnel and httpd and I can enjoy SSH
over SSL. (actually since I did not want double encryption, I have
started to do telnet over SSL, but that is more or less the same
story).</p>
<p>Other alternatives I have considered:</p>
<ul>
<li>Switching from apache to another http server: it turns out I was unable
  to find any other http server supporting the http CONNECT method (at
  least thttpd, lighttpd and nginx don't support it)</li>
<li>Using a perl script that serves on the port 443, waiting for the CONNECT
  method and forwarding every other message to apache (see
  <a href="http://www.karlrunge.com/x11vnc/connect_switch">connect_switch</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>I did not try this second method, but it seems rather cool. If
anyone does and has any success with it, please leave a comment
here, I am interested. I would also be interested if someone knows
any http server lighter than apache and guaranteed to support the
CONNECT method...</p>
