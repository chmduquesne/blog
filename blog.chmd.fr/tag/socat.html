articles about doing SSH over SSL. I have been improving my configuration
over the years, so the more recent, the better:</p>

<p>Last week, I wrote <a href="../ssh-over-ssl-a-quick-and-minimal-config.html">an article</a> about how to quickly set up a server
and a client for doing ssh over ssl.  In this article, I was using
proxytunnel, but I realized today that it could probably be replaced with
socat (socat can do almost anything)...</p>
<p>The principle is simple: Following the first part of
the tutorial, you make your server accept proxy_connect requests
to its private port localhost:22 through its public port 443,
encapsulating the whole thing in SSL (as a reminder, 22 and 443 are
respectively the standard ports for ssh and ssl).</p>
<p>We now want to configure the ssh clients in order to connect through this
ssl tunnel. I said I was configuring the clients with proxytunnel. The
exact command (in .ssh/config) was:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>proxytunnel -q -E -p server.com:443 -d 127.0.0.1:22
</code></pre></div>

<p>I'll explain it:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>-q</code> is for quiet</li>
<li><code>-E</code> is for encrypting between the proxy and us</li>
<li><code>-p</code> is for choosing the proxy</li>
<li><code>-d</code> is for requesting a destination (from the proxy point of view)</li>
</ul>
<p>So basically, this means: "connect stdio to server.com on port 443 (-p
server.com:443) , in an encrypted way (-E), then from this server, require
to be connected to 127.0.0.1:22 (-d 127.0.0.1:22)".</p>
<p>For those who like to play with all sorts of streams, socat is really the
best tool ever invented. I was wondering if I could reproduce
proxytunnel's behavior with socat, and it turns out you can. Here is how
to proceed: First, create an ssl tunnel between your client's
localhost:1080 and server.com:443:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>socat TCP-LISTEN:1080 OPENSSL:server.com:443
</code></pre></div>

<p>This way, the port 443 of server.com is now available unencrypted
on localhost:1080 Then, use socat and its proxy mode to ask for
localhost:1080 (which is actually server.com:443 unencrypted) to
connect to localhost:22 (which is then server.com:22).</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>socat - PROXY:127.0.0.1:127.0.0.1:22,proxyport=1080
</code></pre></div>

<p>Bingo! You should see the ssh prompt. For the fun, I replaced in my
.ssh/config the former</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>ProxyCommand proxytunnel -q -E -p server.com:443 -d 127.0.0.1:22
</code></pre></div>

<p>with</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>ProxyCommand socat TCP-LISTEN:1080 OPENSSL:server.com:443,verify=0 &amp; socat - PROXY:127.0.0.1:127.0.0.1:22,proxyport=1080
</code></pre></div>

<p><strong>Edit 2015-05-07</strong>: See <a href="https://blog.chmd.fr/ssh-over-ssl-episode-2-replacing-proxytunnel-with-socat.html#comment-2010371675">Vincent's
comment</a>
for a cool idea to wrap the ssh command with the <code>-fMN</code> options.</p>
<p>It works just fine. There is however a flaw in what I did: I use a
hardcoded port, thus I can't establish two ssh connections at the
same time. Forwarding the server.com:443 on localhost:1080 fails
the second time, since this port is already occupied by the first
connection. The best way to fix that would be to use stdio for the
proxy_connect requests, instead of a port of localhost (since the
number of these port is limited). However, with my version of socat
(1.7.1.3), I don't see how to proceed differently: the PROXY method
requires three arguments and one of them is a port. If one of my
readers has a suggestion, he/she's welcome. This remains a cool hack!</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong>: The great <a href="https://darkpan.com/">Marco Fontani</a> gave a cool solution (see the
comments). Here is how my .ssh/config looks like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>Host server.com
    ProxyCommand socat TCP-LISTEN:1080 OPENSSL:server.com:443,verify=0 &amp; sleep 1 &amp;&amp; socat - PROXY:127.0.0.1:127.0.0.1:22,proxyport=1080
    DynamicForward 1080
    ServerAliveInterval 60
    ControlMaster auto
    ControlPath ~/.ssh/tmp/%h_%p_%r
</code></pre></div>
