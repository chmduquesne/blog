        <p>I eventually got sick of wordpress and of my former hoster <a href="http://free.fr">free.fr</a>.
Wordpress is probably awesome if you are a team of 15 authors who want to
handle mass production of articles with a nice web interface. On the other
hand, it needs constant updates, and the last ones where requiring a
version of php that my hoster did not provide.</p>
<p>Looking for an alternative, I found the <a href="http://nicdumz.fr/blog/2010/12/why-blogofile/">argument of nicdumz about
blogofile</a> pretty much convincing: why use php and databases where flat
html files could be just enough? I have thus decided to go for a static
website generator, and while I am at it, to host my blog on amazon s3.
This brings me the confort of writing my articles on vim, to version them
on git and to manage the whole process from a makefile.</p>
<h1>Moving</h1>
<p>If anyone who reads me plans to make such a move (wordpress to pelican),
I'll summarize the steps I went through.</p>
<h2>Extracting your articles</h2>
<p>Being open and in the spirit of every good free software, wordpress lets
you export your blog using an xml format. Pelican can <a href="https://github.com/ametaireau/pelican/blob/master/tools/pelican-import">take advantage</a>
of this xml file to generate rst files using pandoc. Or if you are lazy,
you can just provide an rss feed to the pelican importer, but you'll still
miss a way to get the comments.</p>
<h2>Extracting your comments</h2>
<p>Pelican does not provide a comment system by itself, but integrates nicely
with <a href="http://disqus.com/">disqus</a>. Just make an account and upload the Wordpress xml export
file I mentioned. Disqus provides a way to import comments from such a
file. You will later be able to reattach threads to their articles by
providing a csv map file following the syntax:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">old_url</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">new_url</span>
</pre></div>


<h2>Setting up an amazon account</h2>
<p>The next step is to set up an amazon account for use with s3, and to buy a
domain name if you don't already own one. I bought the latter using
<a href="http://www.gandi.net/">gandi.net</a>, and I used <a href="https://github.com/enigmacurry/vaporfile">vaporfile</a> to set up an amazon bucket. I
don't see much to add here, given the fact vaporfile provides a friendly
wizard that tells you what to do quite accurately.</p>
<h1>What I could not fix</h1>
<p>The blog entries on my previous blog were obtained through links looking
like</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="s">&quot;http://chm.duquesne.free.fr/blog/?p=xxx&quot;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Whereas on the new version, they look like</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="s">&quot;http://blog.chmd.fr/title-of-the-article.html&quot;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>It would have been cool to be able to put 301 redirect entries in a
.htaccess, for the sake of SEO-friendliness. However, this would require
some url rewriting, which <a href="http://free.fr">free</a> does not support. I decided to skip
this step. I am keeping <a href="https://github.com/chmduquesne/blog/blob/master/legacy/urlmap.csv">a map</a> between the former and the new urls,
just in case I'd have the courage to write these redirections in php...</p>
