discreetly as possible, by concealing the SSH packets into SSL. The

&lt;p&gt;In this article, I am describing how to SSH to a remote server as
discreetly as possible, by concealing the SSH packets into SSL. The
server will still be able to run an SSL website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rationale&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In most cases, when your outgoing firewall blocks ssh, you can work around
with &lt;a href="http://www.rutschle.net/tech/sslh.shtml"&gt;sslh&lt;/a&gt;, a tool that listens
on the port 443 server-side, and selectively forwards, depending on the
packet type, the incoming TCP connections to a local SSH or SSL service.
You can then happily ssh to your server on the port 443 (normally
dedicated to HTTPS), and also run a website on the same server so your
connections look you are just harmlessly visiting this website. However,
if your firewall is really sneaky, it will detect that you are sending the
wrong packet type to the SSL port, and block your connection. In this
case, there is not much choice: we must hide the SSH connection into a
real SSL tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Comment for the long time readers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know, I know: I covered this topic a few times already (here are the
&lt;a href="/ssh-over-ssl-a-quick-and-minimal-config.html"&gt;first&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="/ssh-over-ssl-episode-2-replacing-proxytunnel-with-socat.html"&gt;second&lt;/a&gt;,
and &lt;a href="/ssh-over-ssl-episode-3-avoiding-using-a-patched-apache.html"&gt;third&lt;/a&gt;
episodes). All of these setups were relying on a feature of HTTP 1.1
called CONNECT. However, it turns out that most webserver do not implement
this CONNECT feature. As a consequence, if you wanted to do this, you were
more or less stuck with Apache. This time, we are breaking free from
Apache, with a HAproxy-based configuration. We will use HAproxy advanced
packet inspection capabilities to implement a switch of protocol, the same
way sslh works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Server configuration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some assumptions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The port 443 of your server is publicly reachable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It runs ssh (but no need for the port 22 to be reachable)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some web server is running on the port 80 and it supports the
  'X-Forwarded-Proto' header (see the documentation of your webserver to
  enable that).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have generated ssl certificates (you copied the public key and the
  private key in the same file /etc/ssl/private/certs.pem)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, you need to setup HAproxy. HAproxy defines backends and frontends, and it
can communicate with these backends both at the HTTP and at the TCP level. Let
us start with the backends:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The web server backend: we tell HAproxy that a server is running on the
port 80, and speaks HTTP. On this backend, we add a X-Forwarded-Proto
header, such that the web server knows that the clients are connecting
securely. If you expose the same backend with HAproxy on the port 80,
don't forget to filter the X-Forwarded-Proto header!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;backend secure_http
    reqadd X-Forwarded-Proto:\ https
    rspadd Strict-Transport-Security:\ max-age=31536000
    mode http
    option httplog
    option forwardfor
    server local_http_server 127.0.0.1:80
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The ssh server:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;backend ssh
    mode tcp
    option tcplog
    server ssh 127.0.0.1:22
    timeout server 2h
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And now, the magic. This happens in the frontend section. We listen in TCP mode
and inspect the connections. Depending on whether we see ssh or not, we hook it
to one of the backends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;frontend ssl
    bind X.X.X.X:443 ssl crt /etc/ssl/private/certs.pem no-sslv3
    mode tcp
    option tcplog
    tcp-request inspect-delay 5s
    tcp-request content accept if HTTP

    acl client_attempts_ssh payload(0,7) -m bin 5353482d322e30

    use_backend ssh if !HTTP
    use_backend ssh if client_attempts_ssh
    use_backend secure_http if HTTP
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Once you are done, you can test if this works by connecting on the server
with openssl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;openssl s_client -connect server.com:443 -quiet
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you see a string that looks like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_6.6.1p1 Debian-7
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;then everything went fine!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Connecting from an SSH client&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To connect to your server from linux, just drop this in your ~/.ssh/config:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Host server.com
    ProxyCommand openssl s_client -connect server.com:443 -quiet
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you are on windows and you cannot install anything client side, there
is also a solution for you. Download socat and putty (none of them
requires admin rights). Then, with socat, run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;socat TCP-LISTEN:8888 OPENSSL:server.com:443,verify=0
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And with putty, direct your client to 127.0.0.1 on the port 8888.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;For the technically aware readers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how does this work exactly? Basically, the &lt;a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4253#section-4.2"&gt;RFC 4253, section
4.2&lt;/a&gt; states that clients
must send a string that starts with 'SSH-2.0' (this is also how sslh does
it). Moreover, 5353482d322e30 is the binary representation of the string
'SSH-2.0'. So everything boils down to this line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;acl client_attempts_ssh payload(0,7) -m bin 5353482d322e30
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;When a new connection is made on the port 443, HAproxy decrypts the SSL
layer, and checks whether the stream of data sent by the client starts
with this string. We use the result of this condition to choose the
backend. This handles the case of 'active' SSH clients (like
openssh-client on linux), who send a packet as soon as they connect.
There are also 'passive' SSH clients (like putty), who wait for the server
to send a string. These clients will get that string after 5 seconds (the
inspect-delay).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

are able to look at these pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href="http://blog.chmd.fr/sigal-a-static-gallery-generator.html"&gt;recently&lt;/a&gt;
set up a self-hosted gallery for my pictures. Obviously, I did this
because I wanted to stop giving my content to external platforms, but also
to gain some level of privacy: I want to limit the number of people who
are able to look at these pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While setting up the gallery was relatively easy, restricting the access
was an interesting problem. I did not want to use a global
&lt;code&gt;username:password&lt;/code&gt; combination, because this kind of credentials
inevitably become public at some point. A different combination for each
user would have been better, but some people are not as careful as I am
with their own credentials, and they may just give away their own access
to others. It is also a lot of maintenance, and I don't want to deal with
the risks involved with securely processing my friends' passwords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then had a look at single sign on solutions such as openid. This kind of
technology was appealing, for several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No password to process on my side&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People would identify with a very personal account (gmail, facebook),
  that they are unlikely to be willing to share with anyone else.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is very easy to use for the end user.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have thus been looking for a solution to get openid/oauth authentication
to cooperate with lighttpd in order to protect my new gallery. After some
work, I came up with &lt;a href="https://git.chmd.fr/?p=lighttpd-external-auth;a=blob_plain;f=external-auth.lua"&gt;a lua magnet
script&lt;/a&gt;
that does the job. It is inspired by &lt;a href="https://github.com/tai/mod-auth-ticket-for-lighttpd"&gt;this
module&lt;/a&gt;, but it does
not require to be compiled and works out of the box on recent versions of
lighttpd (e.g.  debian stable). I also believe that it offers &lt;a href="https://github.com/tai/mod-auth-ticket-for-lighttpd/issues/4"&gt;a better
security&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It works pretty well! You can try to visit
&lt;a href="https://gallery.chmd.fr"&gt;gallery.chmd.fr&lt;/a&gt;  and you should be presented
with my very own login page. Should you try to login, the script will
gently tell you that though your openid/oauth login was successful, you
cannot access the gallery because it is a privilege reserved to the people
I explicitly authorized. Beware that if you are not using linux, you might
experiment a warning from your browser: that is because I use a
certificate signed by &lt;a href="http://www.cacert.org/"&gt;cacert&lt;/a&gt;, a community-driven
certificate authority whose root certificate is not included in commercial
OS (yet).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to use this script on your own lighttpd server, I have set up
a &lt;a href="http://lighttpd-external-auth.chmd.fr/"&gt;dedicated website&lt;/a&gt; to explain
how to proceed. Check it out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One last thing: I am not a security expert, and I did this for fun. I
believe it is pretty secure (provided you trust the third parties
involved, of course), but I still have to warn you: don't use this to
protect important documents. If you have knowledge about security and want
to comment - or even better: to contribute - be my guest!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="openid lighttpd"></category></entry><entry><title>Git on lighttpd</title><link href="http://blog.chmd.fr/git-on-lighttpd.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-08-08T16:09:00+02:00</published><updated>2013-08-08T16:09:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Tof</name></author><id>tag:blog.chmd.fr,2013-08-08:/git-on-lighttpd.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Intro&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I switched to lighttpd. The main reason for this change was the ease of
configuration: for example, with apache, when you want to serve the same
website with and without ssl, you end up doing something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;# file: /etc/apache2/sites-available/domain.com.conf
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;VirtualHost&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;*:80&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

    Include /etc/apache2/domain.com.inc.conf
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/VirtualHost&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;VirtualHost&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;*:443&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    Include /etc/apache2/domain.com.inc.conf
    SSLEngine On
    SSLCertificateFile /etc/ssl/private/domain.com.pem
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/VirtualHost&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

# file: /etc/apache2/sites-available/domain.com.inc.conf
ServerName domain.com
DocumentRoot /var/www/domain.com
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Including the website config as a separate file is pretty much the only
way to accomplish this without duplicating this config in both
virtualhosts. That is two files to maintain, for one domain.  If you want
to do this for every domain you control, you have to multiply the files
and includes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing this with lighttpd is really easier:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;# file /etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf
$SERVER[&amp;quot;socket&amp;quot;] == &amp;quot;:443&amp;quot; {
    ssl.engine              = &amp;quot;enable&amp;quot;
    ssl.pemfile             = &amp;quot;/etc/ssl/private/domain.com.pem&amp;quot;
}
$HTTP[&amp;quot;host&amp;quot;] == &amp;quot;domain.com&amp;quot; {
    server.document-root    = &amp;quot;/var/www/domain.com&amp;quot;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h1&gt;git and lighttpd&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let's do cool things. One of the subdomains I own is dedicated to
hosting my public git repositories. I (quite obviously) named it
&lt;a href="http://git.chmd.fr"&gt;http://git.chmd.fr&lt;/a&gt;. I want to use it for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Serving a gitweb instance to browse all repositories, such that
  &lt;a href="https://git.chmd.fr/?p=netmon.git"&gt;https://git.chmd.fr/?p=netmon.git&lt;/a&gt;
  takes you to browsing the repository of netmon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Serving the git protocol, such that
  &lt;code&gt;git clone https://git.chmd.fr/netmon.git&lt;/code&gt; clones this repository.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combining the two was tricky, but I ended up finding how to proceed. Here
is the relevant part of my config:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$HTTP[&amp;quot;host&amp;quot;] == &amp;quot;git.chmd.fr&amp;quot; {

    # This takes care of serving gitweb
    server.document-root    = &amp;quot;/usr/share/gitweb&amp;quot;
    cgi.assign = ( &amp;quot;.cgi&amp;quot; =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;&amp;quot; )
    server.indexfiles = ( &amp;quot;gitweb.cgi&amp;quot; )

    # And this condition matches git objects
    $HTTP[&amp;quot;url&amp;quot;] =~ &amp;quot;(?x)^/(.*/(HEAD | info/refs | objects/(info/[^/]+ | [0-9a-f]{2}/[0-9a-f]{38} | pack/pack-[0-9a-f]{40}\.(pack|idx)) | git-(upload|receive)-pack))$&amp;quot; {
        alias.url  += ( &amp;quot;&amp;quot; =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;/usr/lib/git-core/git-http-backend&amp;quot;)
        cgi.assign = (&amp;quot;&amp;quot; =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;&amp;quot;)
        setenv.add-environment = (
            &amp;quot;GIT_PROJECT_ROOT&amp;quot; =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;/home/www/git-public-repos/&amp;quot;,
            &amp;quot;GIT_HTTP_EXPORT_ALL&amp;quot; =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;&amp;quot;
            )
    }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Combined with the trick from above, you can get this to work on both http
and https. I hope this will help others!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="git gitweb server"></category></entry><entry><title>Jabber notifications on ssh login</title><link href="http://blog.chmd.fr/jabber-notifications-on-ssh-login.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-09-19T15:33:00+02:00</published><updated>2012-09-19T15:33:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Tof</name></author><id>tag:blog.chmd.fr,2012-09-19:/jabber-notifications-on-ssh-login.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I coined this little trick the other day, I thought I might share it.

wanted, for fun, to be notified on gtalk everytime someone logs in my
server. You never know, maybe I could discover unexpected connections. It
turned out to be possible, and the whole thing costed me reading a couple
of manpages and typing 5 lines of code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you do the same thing with you own server, let me claim here that I
am absolutely not a security expert. It is more an experiment than
anything else, so I suggest being really careful and read all the manpages
involved if you want to do the same thing. Also, I'd be happy to be
notified of any potential threat in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, you can have PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules, the thing
that handles authentication on Linux) execute external commands. The
module in question is called &lt;code&gt;pam_exec&lt;/code&gt;, and it is often used to rebuild
databases e.g. when passwords are changed. It can also be activated when
someone logs in. The manpage explains that the following PAM items are
exported as environment variables to the program executed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; PAM_RHOST, PAM_RUSER, PAM_SERVICE, PAM_TTY, PAM_USER, PAM_TYPE
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I decided to use it to my advantage. I created on jabber.org an account
for my server. I added it in my gmail friends, and I wrote this little
script, using sendxmpp (saved as &lt;code&gt;/usr/local/bin/login_notify&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class="highlighttable"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="linenos"&gt;&lt;div class="linenodiv"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;1
2
3
4
5&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class="code"&gt;&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ch"&gt;#!/bin/sh&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$PAM_USER&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;@`hostname` logged from &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$PAM_RHOST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
    sendxmpp -u server_account -j jabber.org -p xxxx me@gmail.com &amp;gt;/dev/null &lt;span class="m"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;exit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the sendxmpp command runs in background and that its exit status
is ignored. Otherwise PAM would wait for the command to return before
letting me in, and it would deny me the access if the notification failed
to be delivered. Two things I clearly want to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, the following line goes at the end of &lt;code&gt;/etc/pam.d/sshd&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;session         optional        pam_exec.so             /usr/local/bin/login_notify
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There you go, notifications each time someone logs in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Are you doing this for real? Read on...&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, just a couple of extra instructions for you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be really really careful before modifying &lt;code&gt;/etc/pam.d/sshd&lt;/code&gt;. If you
  put a bogus command in there, you might screw up your remote access.
  Please double check that the command &lt;code&gt;/usr/local/bin/login_notify&lt;/code&gt; is
  running with no error. Only when you are sure of that, you can add the
  line to &lt;code&gt;/etc/pam.d/sshd&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't forget to &lt;code&gt;chmod +x /usr/local/bin/login_notify&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you run &lt;code&gt;/usr/local/bin/login_notify&lt;/code&gt;, you should receive a
  jabber message. If you don't, then you have to verify that you can
  actually send messages to your gmail account. Use a jabber client

&lt;a href="http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html"&gt;diceware method&lt;/a&gt;. You basically pick a die and throw it repeatedly
to determine the words of your passphrase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To associate a word with the results of the die, you are given a list of
words that looks like what follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;...
46154 ox
46155 oxyda
46156 oxyde
46161 oxyder
46162 oy
46163 oz
46164 ozone
46165 ozones
46166 p
46211 pa
46212 pacha
46213 pack
46214 packs
46215 pacte
...
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The numbers indicate what word you should pick on the base of 5 throws.
For example if you throw 4, 6, 1, 5, 5, you should pick the word 46155,
which is "oxyda". You then repeat this process until you have 6 or 7
words. Pick the words in the order you got them, and you now have a new
secure passphrase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I like about this method is that it is &lt;strong&gt;fully automated&lt;/strong&gt;, yet
perfectly secure. You don't have to worry about making a choice: the die
makes it for you, and you still end up with something that is easy to
remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, I read &lt;a href="http://xkcd.com/936/"&gt;xkcd&lt;/a&gt; and I was already using long sentences that made
sense only if you are me, but this method beats mine, since there is no
way I was picking these words randomly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I could not find a list of french words, I quickly made &lt;a href="https://github.com/chmduquesne/diceware-fr"&gt;my own&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="security"></category><category term="passphrase"></category></entry><entry><title>SSH over SSL, episode 3: Avoiding using a patched apache.</title><link href="http://blog.chmd.fr/ssh-over-ssl-episode-3-avoiding-using-a-patched-apache.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-07-11T13:12:00+02:00</published><updated>2011-07-11T13:12:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Tof</name></author><id>tag:blog.chmd.fr,2011-07-11:/ssh-over-ssl-episode-3-avoiding-using-a-patched-apache.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you are reading this, you might be interested in the full list of my

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another episode of my adventures of firewall bypassing...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to use the http CONNECT method to tunnel ssh, you have to
configure apache as I previously showed in &lt;a href="../ssh-over-ssl-a-quick-and-minimal-config.html"&gt;a previous post&lt;/a&gt;.  Sadly,
the current version of apache does not allow to do it over https. There
has been a &lt;a href="https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=29744"&gt;bug report&lt;/a&gt; for years and various patches have been
proposed, but as far as I know, still not any of these patches made it to
the official release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My solution so far was to apply the patch manually and recompile the
relevant module. Doing this for every release can be annoying, so I've
been looking for a different solution that would not involve recompiling
apache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit 2015-05-07:&lt;/strong&gt; This bug has been fixed for 3 years. I still
recommend not to use the CONNECT method, because only apache supports it
and it will force you to use it. There are cooler, faster webservers out
there. Using the HAproxy based configuration is by far the most flexible
way I know (it allows you to use any web server, apache included).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The workaround I now use is fun enough for me to talk about it here. Since
apache has no problem with the CONNECT method when SSL is not involved, I
have decided to do the SSL part by myself. Thus, I configure apache to
serve normally on the port 80, and I use stunnel to secure apache on the
port 443. Here is how I do it: I remove the SSL part of my apache config
and I add in my (normal, unencrypted) apache configuration:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;ProxyRequests On
AllowConnect 22
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt; Proxy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    Order deny,allow
    Deny from all
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/Proxy&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;Proxy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;127.0.0.1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    Order deny,allow
    Allow from all
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/Proxy&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Then, I install stunnel, and I set it up to listen on the port 443
(https) and to forward it to the port 80 (http).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;cert = /etc/stunnel/stunnel.pem
...
[https]
accept  = 443
connect = 80
TIMEOUTclose = 0
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;stunnel requires a bit of configuration. From the &lt;a href="http://www.stunnel.org/?page=docs"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;, here
is how to generate a certificate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;cd /etc/stunnel
openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -nodes -config stunnel.cnf -out stunnel.pem -keyout stunnel.pem
chown stunnel:stunnel stunnel.pem
chmod 600 stunnel.pem
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I also nedded to add in /etc/hosts.allow&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sshd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ALL&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;stunnel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ALL&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;https&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ALL&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And that is all. I restart stunnel and httpd and I can enjoy SSH
over SSL. (actually since I did not want double encryption, I have
started to do telnet over SSL, but that is more or less the same
story).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other alternatives I have considered:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Switching from apache to another http server: it turns out I was unable
  to find any other http server supporting the http CONNECT method (at
  least thttpd, lighttpd and nginx don't support it)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using a perl script that serves on the port 443, waiting for the CONNECT
  method and forwarding every other message to apache (see
  &lt;a href="http://www.karlrunge.com/x11vnc/connect_switch"&gt;connect_switch&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not try this second method, but it seems rather cool. If
anyone does and has any success with it, please leave a comment
here, I am interested. I would also be interested if someone knows
any http server lighter than apache and guaranteed to support the
CONNECT method...&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="ssh"></category><category term="ssl"></category><category term="stunnel"></category><category term="apache"></category></entry><entry><title>Using a shell version of supergenpass from vimperator/pentadactyl</title><link href="http://blog.chmd.fr/using-a-shell-version-of-supergenpass-from-vimperatorpentadactyl.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-12-20T18:39:00+01:00</published><updated>2010-12-20T18:39:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Tof</name></author><id>tag:blog.chmd.fr,2010-12-20:/using-a-shell-version-of-supergenpass-from-vimperatorpentadactyl.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last week, I was glad to be a &lt;a href="http://supergenpass.com/"&gt;supergenpass&lt;/a&gt;

user: &lt;a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/gawker-hacked-2010-12"&gt;gawker.com was
hacked&lt;/a&gt; and a huge
number of their username/password hashes was exposed.  While I am not
happy with the fact my email was part of the leak and I've stopped reading
anything from them, I know there are very little chances for me to get
problems with that, because the password I used on their site was not
reused elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href="http://akibjorklund.com/2009/supergenpass-is-not-that-secure"&gt;supergenpass is not that
secure&lt;/a&gt;.
Any script executed in the same page as supergenpass is able to see your
master password. If the webmaster of the site you are visiting is evil, he
could grab your master password and hack all your accounts. If you are a
vimperator/pentadactyl user, it is easy to fix that, by executing
supergenpass as a shell command (What follows is from my pentadactylrc):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;map -modes=n,v &amp;lt;C-F6&amp;gt; y:!~/.scripts/supergenpass&amp;lt;Space&amp;gt;&amp;#39;&amp;lt;S-Insert&amp;gt;&amp;#39;&amp;lt;Return&amp;gt;&amp;lt;Esc&amp;gt;2gi&amp;lt;S-Insert&amp;gt;&amp;lt;Return&amp;gt;
map -modes=i &amp;lt;C-F6&amp;gt; &amp;lt;Esc&amp;gt;&amp;lt;C-F6&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;code&gt;~/.scripts/supergenpass&lt;/code&gt; is a python supergenpass script I
customized for my needs (it uses the gtk-based ssh-askpass program to get
the password, instead of using the python getpass library, which is
command line based). You'll find it in &lt;a href="https://bitbucket.org/chmduquesne/dotfiles/src/624d4f104f7d/scripts/supergenpass"&gt;my
dotfiles&lt;/a&gt;.
Original version from &lt;a href="http://michael.gorven.za.net/blog/2009/06/18/supergenpass-cellphones-command-line"&gt;Michael
Gorven&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little explanation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;CTRL-F6&lt;/code&gt; is the shortcut to trigger the script (I've been using it for
  ages, it is originally the default shortcut used in the &lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/3282/"&gt;password hasher
  firefox extension&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; yanks the url,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;:!~/.scripts/supergenpass&amp;lt;Space&amp;gt;'&amp;lt;S-Insert&amp;gt;'&amp;lt;Return&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; will call the
  program &lt;code&gt;~/.scripts/supergenpass&lt;/code&gt; with the content of the clipboard
  (using &lt;code&gt;Shift+Insert&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Esc&amp;gt;2gi&lt;/code&gt; will then focus the second field (I usually call it once I've
  filled my login)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;S-Insert&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; will paste the clipboard (now filled with the generated
  password) in this focused field.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, I wrote &lt;a href="../ssh-over-ssl-a-quick-and-minimal-config.html"&gt;an article&lt;/a&gt; about how to quickly set up a server
and a client for doing ssh over ssl.  In this article, I was using
proxytunnel, but I realized today that it could probably be replaced with
socat (socat can do almost anything)...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The principle is simple: Following the first part of
the tutorial, you make your server accept proxy_connect requests
to its private port localhost:22 through its public port 443,
encapsulating the whole thing in SSL (as a reminder, 22 and 443 are
respectively the standard ports for ssh and ssl).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now want to configure the ssh clients in order to connect through this
ssl tunnel. I said I was configuring the clients with proxytunnel. The
exact command (in .ssh/config) was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;proxytunnel -q -E -p server.com:443 -d 127.0.0.1:22
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I'll explain it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;-q&lt;/code&gt; is for quiet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;-E&lt;/code&gt; is for encrypting between the proxy and us&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;-p&lt;/code&gt; is for choosing the proxy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;-d&lt;/code&gt; is for requesting a destination (from the proxy point of view)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So basically, this means: "connect stdio to server.com on port 443 (-p
server.com:443) , in an encrypted way (-E), then from this server, require
to be connected to 127.0.0.1:22 (-d 127.0.0.1:22)".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who like to play with all sorts of streams, socat is really the
best tool ever invented. I was wondering if I could reproduce
proxytunnel's behavior with socat, and it turns out you can. Here is how
to proceed: First, create an ssl tunnel between your client's
localhost:1080 and server.com:443:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;socat TCP-LISTEN:1080 OPENSSL:server.com:443
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This way, the port 443 of server.com is now available unencrypted
on localhost:1080 Then, use socat and its proxy mode to ask for
localhost:1080 (which is actually server.com:443 unencrypted) to
connect to localhost:22 (which is then server.com:22).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;socat - PROXY:127.0.0.1:127.0.0.1:22,proxyport=1080
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Bingo! You should see the ssh prompt. For the fun, I replaced in my
.ssh/config the former&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;ProxyCommand proxytunnel -q -E -p server.com:443 -d 127.0.0.1:22
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;ProxyCommand socat TCP-LISTEN:1080 OPENSSL:server.com:443,verify=0 &amp;amp; socat - PROXY:127.0.0.1:127.0.0.1:22,proxyport=1080
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit 2015-05-07&lt;/strong&gt;: See &lt;a href="https://blog.chmd.fr/ssh-over-ssl-episode-2-replacing-proxytunnel-with-socat.html#comment-2010371675"&gt;Vincent's
comment&lt;/a&gt;
for a cool idea to wrap the ssh command with the &lt;code&gt;-fMN&lt;/code&gt; options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It works just fine. There is however a flaw in what I did: I use a
hardcoded port, thus I can't establish two ssh connections at the
same time. Forwarding the server.com:443 on localhost:1080 fails
the second time, since this port is already occupied by the first
connection. The best way to fix that would be to use stdio for the
proxy_connect requests, instead of a port of localhost (since the
number of these port is limited). However, with my version of socat
(1.7.1.3), I don't see how to proceed differently: the PROXY method
requires three arguments and one of them is a port. If one of my
readers has a suggestion, he/she's welcome. This remains a cool hack!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit&lt;/strong&gt;: The great &lt;a href="https://darkpan.com/"&gt;Marco Fontani&lt;/a&gt; gave a cool solution (see the
comments). Here is how my .ssh/config looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Host server.com
    ProxyCommand socat TCP-LISTEN:1080 OPENSSL:server.com:443,verify=0 &amp;amp; sleep 1 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; socat - PROXY:127.0.0.1:127.0.0.1:22,proxyport=1080
    DynamicForward 1080
    ServerAliveInterval 60
    ControlMaster auto
    ControlPath ~/.ssh/tmp/%h_%p_%r

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you are behind a vicious firewall that filters outgoing ssh and
vpn, and the only safe way out is SSL. In this article, I'll
describe how to SSH over SSL to a machine that runs an ssh server
and apache2. This machine will still be able to run an SSL website.
Clients will connect using a standard ssh client and proxytunnel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Server configuration&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I assume that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The server is accessible on the port 443 through the "server.com" domain
  name (otherwise using the raw ip will do the trick).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It also runs an ssh server (but no need for the port 22 to be
  reachable).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You already have set up certificates for SSL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You've enabled the modules for ssl (a2enmod ssl)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You're running the default ssl website in
  /etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl and it is enabled (a2ensite
  default-ssl)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You've enabled necessary modules for proxying and using proxy connect
  methods (a2enmod proxy proxy_connect proxy_http)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;File /etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's minimalistic on purpose, so you can see what is really needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;IfModule&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;mod_ssl.c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;VirtualHost&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;_default_:443&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    # enable ssl
    SSLEngine on
    SSLCertificateFile    /etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem
    SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key
    # proxytunnel
    Include /etc/apache2/proxytunnel/main.conf
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/VirtualHost&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/IfModule&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h1&gt;File /etc/apache2/proxytunnel/main.conf&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It enables forward proxying for anyone, but only if the client asks for
127.0.0.1:22 (other requests will be denied). This results in exposing the
port 22 (ssh) of your server through a proxy, in an encrypted way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;ProxyRequests On
AllowConnect 22
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;Proxy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    Order deny,allow
    Deny from all
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/Proxy&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;Proxy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;127.0.0.1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    Order deny,allow
    Allow from all
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/Proxy&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h1&gt;Client configuration&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I assume that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An ssh client is installed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;proxytunnel is installed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, you'll need to test your server setting using proxytunnel alone.
Since debugging encryption problems can be tedious, at first, I suggest
you set up your server to provide the proxy in a non encrypted way,
commenting the three SSL related lines (you can switch to encrypted when
it works). Proxytunnel can "chain" two proxies (a local one, and a remote
one), but if the place you connect from does not use such a setting, here
is how you can proceed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;proxytunnel -E -p server.com:443 -d 127.0.0.1:22 -v
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;-v is for verbose. Replace it with -q (quiet) if it works. You can say it
works when you are prompted an ssh login. Apache2 used to have &lt;a href="https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=29744"&gt;a bug&lt;/a&gt;
with proxy_connect and SSL, so using encryption may require some extra
work (like patching and recompiling the mod_proxy shared libraries or
using the latest alpha).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;File .ssh/config&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you're done, just drop the working command line in the .ssh/config of
your clients:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Host server.com
    ProxyCommand proxytunnel -q -E -p server.com:443 -d 127.0.0.1:22
    DynamicForward 1080
    ServerAliveInterval 60
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you are stuck, I recommend you read &lt;a href="http://www.saulchristie.co.uk/how-to/bypass-firewalls"&gt;this excellent article&lt;/a&gt;. One
problem remains with this config: If the traffic is correctly monitored,
the ip of you server could be logged (even though it will be impossible to
prove you have been doing something not allowed). First, you should run an
https website on this ip (like a blog, or a code repository), in order to
make this traffic more realistic. What could also be cool would be to
chain proxies, &lt;a href="http://lifehacker.com/5484934/run-your-own-free-proxy-through-the-google-app-engine"&gt;using for example the appengine&lt;/a&gt;. This way your traffic
will look like it's going to google.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="apache"></category><category term="ssh"></category><category term="ssl"></category><category term="tunnel"></category></entry><entry><title>De l'intérêt de détacher des programmes de la console (sans screen)</title><link href="http://blog.chmd.fr/de-linteret-de-detacher-des-programmes-de-la-console-sans-screen.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-04-09T09:57:00+02:00</published><updated>2010-04-09T09:57:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Tof</name></author><id>tag:blog.chmd.fr,2010-04-09:/de-linteret-de-detacher-des-programmes-de-la-console-sans-screen.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Qui n'a jamais perdu par erreur une compilation, une session ssh ou

une fenêtre irssi en fermant une console par inadvertance, à cause
d'un lag réseau, ou bien à cause d'un redémarrage brutal de X11?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Les outils présentés ici permettent de vous affranchir de ce genre
de problème. dtach est un petit programme bien pratique qui sert à
détacher un programme de la console où celui-ci tourne. De manière
simple, ça veut dire que si on quitte le terminal dans lequel on a
lancé le programme détaché, on pourra par une courte commande
récupérer ce programme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exemple, la commande suivante permet de
lancer le programme irssi en détaché, sur le socket /tmp/irssi.sock
(qui sera créé par le programme), où, s'il est déjà lancé, de
récupérer ce programme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;dtach -A /tmp/irssi.sock /usr/bin/irssi
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;J'en connais des tas qui ne jurent que par gnu screen. Mais  à quoi
bon, si on peut se contenter d'un simple alias?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;alias irssi=&amp;#39;dtach -A /tmp/irssi.sock /usr/bin/irssi&amp;#39;`
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Jusque là, je me contentais de deux ou trois alias du genre, et j'avais
une petite fonction au début de mon .zshrc qui me permettait de toujours
lancer mon shell en détaché. Cependant, tout ceci manquant de souplesse,
je me suis intéressé à screen et à ses alternatives, et je dois dire que
je trouve tmux vraiment propre. Je mets de côté tous les aspects de
coupage d'écran en deux, onglets et tutti quanti, qui  sont plus ou moins
inutiles quand on utilise &lt;a href="http://awesome.naquadah.org/"&gt;un vrai window manager&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Si screen et tmux peuvent tous deux ouvrir un nombre illimité de sessions
(screen pouvant, si j'ai bien compris, ouvrir jusqu'à 10 fenêtres au sein
de la même session), tmux offre un mécanisme pour alterner entre
différentes sessions que j'ai cherché en vain dans screen (je vois d'ici
les ardents défenseurs de leur programme favori venir me crucifier dans
les commentaires: tant pis, si ça existe, j'assume ma mauvaise lecture des
pages de manuel).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dans tmux, avec la configuration par défaut, un simple CTRL-b suivi de s
montre une liste à choix des sessions ouvertes (attachées ou détachées) et
il suffit alors de selectionner une entrée pour que tmux se connecte à
ladite session (et si vous aimez couper l'écran en deux et mettre
plusieurs fenêtres dans la même session, vous pouvez, sans limitation de
nombre).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voici quelques lignes que j'ai rajoutées au début de mon .zshrc: elles
garantissent qu'une nouvelle session tmux est toujours lancée avec le
shell. La fermeture de la session en cours entraine l'essai de connection
à une autre session, sauf s'il n'y a plus aucune session de lancée.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;# TMUX
# if no session is started, start a new session
if test -z &lt;span class="cp"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;TMUX&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;; then
    tmux
fi
# when quitting tmux, try to attach
while test -z &lt;span class="cp"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;TMUX&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;; do
    tmux attach || break
done
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Et désormais je lance irssi de la manière suivante:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;# IRSSI IN TMUX
# switch to irssi session (and if necessary starts this session before)
irssi()
{
    if tmux has -t irssi &amp;gt;/dev/null; then
         tmux switch -t irssi
    else
        TMUX=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; tmux new -d -s irssi /usr/bin/irssi
        tmux switch -t irssi
    fi
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Si vous utilisez zsh et/ou urxvt, et que vous souhaitez tenter l'essai, je
vous suggère de jeter un coup d'oeil à &lt;a href="https://github.com/chmduquesne/dotfiles/"&gt;ma configuration&lt;/a&gt; (les
problèmes de couleurs et de scrolling y sont réglés). À noter qu'il existe
d'autres alternatives à gnu screen, dont le très prometteur &lt;a href="http://caca.zoy.org/wiki/neercs"&gt;neercs&lt;/a&gt;,
qui permet entre autre de détacher des programmes qu'on avait oublié de
lancer dans neercs.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="tmux"></category><category term="irssi"></category><category term="dtach"></category></entry><entry><title>Utilisons incron pour être notifiés des événements du système de fichiers</title><link href="http://blog.chmd.fr/utilisons-incron-pour-etre-notifies-des-evenements-du-systeme-de-fichiers.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-02-18T00:26:00+01:00</published><updated>2010-02-18T00:26:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Tof</name></author><id>tag:blog.chmd.fr,2010-02-18:/utilisons-incron-pour-etre-notifies-des-evenements-du-systeme-de-fichiers.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://incron.aiken.cz/"&gt;incron&lt;/a&gt; est un programme fonctionnant sur

très propre: pour l'utiliser, on spécifie un ou des fichiers à
surveiller, un type d'action à détecter sur le(s) fichier(s) en
question, et une commande à déclencher lorsque l'événement
survient. Je me suis dit que c'était l'occasion où jamais de mettre
à jour un vieux script que j'avais, qui me met au courant des
modifications sur mes logs (je tire l'idée de ce script
&lt;a href="http://www.daemontux.org/?q=node/31"&gt;d'un ancien post sur le planet libre&lt;/a&gt;).
Après avoir installé incron, j'édite ma table de configuration
incron:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;incrontab -e
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Avec mon éditeur favori, je lui mets la ligne suivante:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;/var/log/kernel.log IN_MODIFY sh /home/me/documents/scripts/popLog.sh /var/log/kernel.log
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;popLog.sh est un script qui prend en argument un log, en extrait la
dernière ligne modifiée, la colorise avec `source-highlight`_ et
l'envoie en notification par le biais de `notify-send`_. Le but
de ce script est donc d'afficher le dernier log dans une bulle,
avec coloration syntaxique. Je fournis le script en question, et
j'ajoute quelques explications:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;source-highlight a besoin de parler un code couleurs compris
    par les bulles de notifications. notification-daemon comprend des
    couleurs de type &amp;lt;span color="couleur"&gt;mots à colorier&amp;lt;/span&gt;,
    d'où le fichier supplémentaire awesome.outlang (que j'avais écrit à
    l'origine pour naughty et donc compatible avec celui-ci, pour les
    utilisateurs d'&lt;a href="http://awesome.naquadah.org/"&gt;awesome wm&lt;/a&gt; - à ce
    propos il y a plusieurs entrées dans le wiki pour faire des choses
    semblables).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;incron ne comprend pas bien les variables d'environnement, il
    vaut mieux les redéfinir dans le script, comme je l'ai fait.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;faites attention à ne pas faire n'importe quoi avec incron, il
    est facile de créer une boucle infinie en surveillant par exemple
    /var/log/everything.log (vous notifiant du lancement de ce script,
    et donc générant une nouvelle notification): IN_NO_LOOP est votre
    ami.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;incron prend des chemins absolus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Après tous ces avertissements, voici

Paradoxalement, si on cherche quelque chose de simple, on ne trouve
pas. Ce que je cherchais à faire est on ne peut plus simple à
décrire: quelque chose qui apparaisse une fois par heure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;En effet, le problème des notes persistantes est que l'on finit par ne
plus les voir. Pour cela, j'ai opté pour les notifications. Le principe
est simple: on met sa TODO liste dans le fichier &lt;code&gt;~/TODO&lt;/code&gt;. Une fois par
heure, le contenu de ce fichier est affiché dans une bulle de notification
qui dure 10 secondes. Une façon gentille de rappeler les choses à faire,
intrusive, certe, mais à la durée assez courte pour ne pas être ennuyeuse.
Ça se fait très facilement avec le script suivant:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class="highlighttable"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="linenos"&gt;&lt;div class="linenodiv"&gt;&lt;pre&gt; 1
 2
 3

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# pour que cron sache sur quel moniteur jouer la notification&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;DISPLAY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;:0.0

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;#params&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;todofile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$HOME&lt;/span&gt;/TODO
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;icon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;/usr/share/icons/gnome/32x32/status/dialog-information.png&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;popupTime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;10000&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;urgency&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;low&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;test&lt;/span&gt; -f &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$todofile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nv"&gt;notification&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sb"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;cat &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$todofile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sb"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;
    notify-send -u &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$urgency&lt;/span&gt; -t &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$popupTime&lt;/span&gt; -i &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$icon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; TODO &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$notification&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;fi&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Le script, que j'ai nommé todo.sh est à faire invoquer toutes les
heures par une tache cron:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;0 * * * *  sh &lt;span class="cp"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;HOME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;/documents/scripts/todo.sh

vim, qui pourtant semble méconnue de pas mal de monde, même des
utilisateurs avancés: la commande &lt;code&gt;:GetLatestVimScripts&lt;/code&gt;, ou son
alias &lt;code&gt;:GLVS&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Le principe est simple: vous installez un script pour vim, et vous voulez
que ce script se maintienne à jour (c'est à dire que vous voulez profiter
des versions successives du script par l'auteur).  Au lieu de vous embêter
à vérifier si il y a des nouvelles versions périodiquement et d'avoir à
suivre un procédé d'installation qui differera selon que vous ayez affaire
à un vimscript, un vimball, ou une quelconque archive, vous pouvez tout
simplement dire à vim de gérer tous vos scripts d'un coup. Pour cela, il
vous suffit de maintenir à jour la liste des scripts qui vous intéressent
dans le fichier &lt;code&gt;~/.vim/GetLatest/GetLatestVimScripts.dat&lt;/code&gt;. Le format de
ce fichier est simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;numéro du script&amp;gt; &amp;lt;numéro de version installée du script&amp;gt; :AutoInstall: &amp;lt;nom du script&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Le numéro du script est dans l'url sur sourceforge, donné par &lt;code&gt;scriptid&lt;/code&gt;.
La version installée du script est maintenue directement par la commande
&lt;code&gt;:GLVS&lt;/code&gt;. Si vous voulez être sûr que la mise à jour soit faite, mettez 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maintenant, votre répertoire &lt;code&gt;~/.vim&lt;/code&gt; est assez facile à transporter. J'ai
pour habitude d'en garder une copie "vide", avec une arborescence sous la
forme:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\.vim/
    |-GetLatest/
               |-GetLatestVimScripts.dat
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Un test?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vous pouvez tester l'astuce assez simplement: Sauvez votre répertoire
&lt;code&gt;~/.vim&lt;/code&gt; (si vous en avez un) en le bougeant sous un autre nom, et faites
en un nouveau ou vous recréerez l'arborescence décrite précedemment.
Insérez dans GetLatestVimScripts.dat les lignes suivantes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gh"&gt;ScriptID SourceID Filename&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gh"&gt;--------------------------&lt;/span&gt;
# Les lignes commençant par &amp;#39;#&amp;#39; sont des commentaires
# Les deux premières lignes sont nécessaires
#
# Script permettant d&amp;#39;avoir une complétion grâce à la touche &amp;lt;tab&amp;gt;
# le premier numéro a été obtenu dans l&amp;#39;url du script:
# http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1643
1643 1 :AutoInstall: supertab.vim
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ouvrez vim, tapez :GLVS. Le script va se mettre à jour de
  lui-même.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vous pouvez tester le script, assez sympa, qui permet de
  compléter les mots que vous tapez avec la touche de tabulation
  (pour savoir comment ça se paramètre, lisez le script, pour
  l'instant sa doc est incluse en commentaire dans le code - j'ai
  proposé au mainteneur un patch avec une vraie doc vim, accessible
  par :help et j'ai bon espoir qu'il l'inclue dans une future
  version)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fin de la démo. Vous pouvez supprimer votre répertoire .vim et
  remettre votre ancienne configuration (si vous en aviez une).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Une petite explication supplémentaire s'impose. Le mot clé :AutoInstall:
dans la ligne que j'ai préconisée n'est pas obligatoire. Cela vient du
fait que tous les scripts ne sont pas installables automatiquement (mais
tous sont téléchargeables automatiquement). Cela dit, les scripts
sourceforge sont assez standards et la plupart seront autoinstallables
même si l'auteur du script ne connaissait pas la fonctionnalité. Si jamais
votre script ne s'installe pas correctement, vous pouvez écrire à son
auteur afin qu'il le modifie (ça marche, je l'ai fait &lt;a href="http://slinky.imukuppi.org/2009/10/24/zenburn-v2-13/"&gt;récemment&lt;/a&gt; avec
&lt;a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=415"&gt;zenburn&lt;/a&gt; en aidant son auteur à le mettre sous forme de vimball) et en
attendant, retirer ce mot clé.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;En espérant que ça serve... En bonus, voici la liste des plugins
que j'utilise. C'est très orienté C++. Mon conseil, c'est de vous
abonner au flux rss de vim.org, comme ça vous serez au courant des
plugins sympa qui sortent.&lt;/p&gt;

sortie d'une compilation, je me suis mis en quête d'améliorer mon
quotidien et d'y mettre... des couleurs! Pour ce faire, on cherche
un peu ce qui existe déjà, et on tombe sur colorgcc. C'est
disponible sur pas mal de distributions, c'est juste un script perl
à appeler à la place de gcc, et ça rajoute des couleurs. Pour en
profiter, il suffit de glisser dans vos Makefile&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;CXX=/usr/bin/colorgcc
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Avec les autotools, on peut régler ça à l'invocation du script
configure :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;./configure CXX=/usr/bin/colorgcc
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Bon. Pas mal. Maintenant, les diff. Au boulot, je n'ai pas mieux
sous la main qu'un svn comme gestionnaire de version. Quand je me
tape des svn diff, j'aime bien que ça soit un peu lisible. Et si on
se mettait ça en couleurs? En lisant un peu la doc, on voit qu'il
suffit de se faire un script. Mettons diffwrap.sh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class="highlighttable"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="linenos"&gt;&lt;div class="linenodiv"&gt;&lt;pre&gt; 1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
 7
 8
 9
10
11&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class="code"&gt;&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ch"&gt;#!/bin/sh&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Configure your favorite diff program here.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;DIFF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;/usr/bin/colordiff&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Subversion provides the paths we need as the sixth and seventh&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# parameters.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;LEFT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;RIGHT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Call the diff command&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$DIFF&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$LEFT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$RIGHT&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Return an errorcode of 0 if no differences were detected, 1 if some were.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Any other errorcode will be treated as fatal.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;J'ai installé colordiff pour faire le boulot. Il suffit après
d'éditer \~/.subversion/config, et d'ajouter, section [helpers]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;diff-cmd = /path/to/diffwrap.sh
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Bon ok, mais quand je fais make, j'ai toujours beaucoup de sortie
Il n'y aurait pas moyen de se cantonner aux erreurs gcc lorsqu'il y
en a? Aller, on va baisser un peu ça avec un petit peu (le -j3 est
pour multithreader le make : j'ai un dual core, autant en
profiter).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;alias make=&amp;#39;make -j3 -s&amp;#39;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Bien entendu, en tant qu'adepte de vim, j'utilise aussi beaucoup
:make. Dans le .vimrc, il peut s'avérer utile de glisser alors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;autocmd BufNewFile,BufRead,BufEnter *.cpp,*.hpp set makeprg=make\ -j3\ -s
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Au passage, j'espère que vous connaissiez
&lt;a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1520"&gt;omnicppcomplete&lt;/a&gt;,
qui va chez moi dans la même section du .vimrc:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;autocmd BufNewFile,BufRead,BufEnter *.cpp,*.hpp set omnifunc=omni#cpp#complete#Main
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;On combine tout ça à quelques alias assez connus, et on vit un peu
mieux dans sa console...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;# SOME COLORS
if [ -x /usr/bin/dircolors ]; then
    eval &amp;quot;`dircolors -b`&amp;quot;
    alias ls=&amp;#39;ls --color=auto&amp;#39;
    alias dir=&amp;#39;dir --color=auto&amp;#39;
    alias vdir=&amp;#39;vdir --color=auto&amp;#39;
    alias grep=&amp;#39;grep --color=auto&amp;#39;
    alias fgrep=&amp;#39;fgrep --color=auto&amp;#39;
    alias egrep=&amp;#39;egrep --color=auto&amp;#39;
    alias diff=&amp;#39;colordiff&amp;#39;
    alias less=&amp;#39;less -R&amp;#39;
fi
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Si vous avez des trucs utiles, n'hésitez pas! Je suis en
particulier à la recherche d'un script vim qui exploiterait un rien
les options 'errorformat' et 'QuickFixCmdPost' afin d'améliorer
encore la lisibilité des compilations dans la fenêtre quickfix.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="colors"></category><category term="console"></category></entry><entry><title>Faire un gif animé à partir d'un film</title><link href="http://blog.chmd.fr/faire-un-gif-anime-a-partir-dun-film.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-04-06T21:29:00+02:00</published><updated>2008-04-06T21:29:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Tof</name></author><id>tag:blog.chmd.fr,2008-04-06:/faire-un-gif-anime-a-partir-dun-film.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;J'ai souvent vu des gens poser cette question : comment fait-on un

gif animé à partir d'un film sous ubuntu? Avec ffmpeg, rien de plus
aisé. Sous gnome, avec nautilus-actions, il vous sera même possible
de faire clic droit&gt;générer un gif animé à partir de cette vidéo.
Commencez-donc par installer ffmpeg et nautilus-actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;sudo apt-get install ffmpeg nautilus-actions
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;La syntaxe pour réaliser un gif animé à partir d'un film est&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;ffmpeg -i fichier_entree.avi -pix_fmt rgb24 \
 -s 120x120\
 -r 5\
 fichier_sortie.gif
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vous pouvez régler la hauteur et la largeur du fichier de
    sortie en touchant au paramètre '-s 120x120' (cependant 120x120 est
    une taille raisonnable pour les forums).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vous pouvez régler le nombre d'image par seconde prises dans le
    film d'origine en touchant au paramètre '-r 5'.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bon, maintenant, offrons-nous la possibilité de gérer tout ça à
coup de clic droit. Sous Ubuntu, si vous avez bien installé
nautilus-actions, ça se passe dans
système&gt;préférences&gt;configuration des actions de nautilus. Faites
'Ajouter'. Configurez la nouvelle action comme suit :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="nautilus-actions-1.png" src="images/nautilus-actions-1.png"&gt;
&lt;img alt="nautilus-actions-2.png" src="images/nautilus-actions-2.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ce qui est important, c'est le champ 'paramètres' :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-i %M -pix_fmt rgb24 -s 120x120 -r 5 %M.gif
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Vous pouvez désormais vous amuser à faire toute sorte de gif
animés. Le seul défaut : les fichiers produits ont le désavantage
de ne pas boucler. Heureusement, il est très facile d'y remédier
avec the gimp. Il suffit d'ouvrir le .gif, et de le ré-enregistrer
en laissant cochée l'option 'boucle infinie'... Dans un prochain
billet, je vous expliquerais comment couper votre vidéo pour
extraire une scène qui vous intéresse. Ainsi, il vous sera possible
de chainer les deux méthodes pour faire exactement le gif que vous
voulez.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="libre"></category></entry></feed>
